This repo contains the setup, configurations, and automation scripts I use to manage and experiment with my own homelab environment. It’s a personal space for learning and testing self-hosted services, infrastructure-as-code, and network optimization. While tailored to my needs, it can serve as inspiration or reference for anyone interested in building a similar setup at home.
